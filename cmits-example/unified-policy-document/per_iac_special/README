This directory is a place where special per-IA-control things can be manually
written.

Normally the shaney script, which is run as part of building the unified policy
document, finds every place where an IA control is declared to be implemented,
and copies the following paragraph into a per-IAC file, thus automatically
summarizing for each IA control the ways in which the control is implemented
throughout the policy.

But in some cases, the implementation of the IA control cannot be automatically
summarized. For example, DCCS-1 requires that DoD configuration guidance
documents form the basis for configuration. That control is implemented by the
whole policy, not a part of it; so no part of the policy can be tagged, "Here's
where DCCS-1 is implemented."

In these cases, a summary must exist so the auditors can read it, but it needs
to be written for the purpose, rather than summarized by automatic excerpting.
Those summaries are written here, in this directory, as files named after IA
controls.

In each file, write only the paragraph which summarizes compliance with the
given control; do not, for example, write a \section directive at the top of
the file: this will be taken care of for you.
