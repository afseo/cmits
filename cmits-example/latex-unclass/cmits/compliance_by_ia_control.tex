\chapter{Compliance by IA control}
\label{iac-compliance-summary}
This chapter summarizes measures taken to implement IA controls within
this policy. Full details are to be found in the referenced sections.

So that future expansion will not disrupt the section numbering, there is
a section for each IA control set forth in DoDI 8500.2, even though this
\CMITSPolicy\ does not implement every IA control. Sections reserved for
future expansion have shorter titles so you can easily skip them.

% These sections are named after IA controls - we don't want to then tack
% the same IA control names onto the end of their names.
