\chapter{Policy}
\label{Policy}
Here follows the policy itself, broken into sections by module, and
subsections by class.
\implements{iacontrol}{DCCS-1}%
As required, DoD reference documents constitute the primary source for
security configuration done by this document.
\implements{iacontrol}{ECSC-1}\implements{databasestig}{DG0175}%
This \CMITSPolicy\, where applied, configures the ``DBMS host platform''
for ``compliance with applicable STIG requirements.'' It also
``hardens'' some ``separately configured components that access the
database including web servers, application servers, report servers,
etc.'' See the compliance index (\S\ref{index_compliance} for overviews.
When properly installed, this \CMITSPolicy\ also ``regularly audit[s] the
security configuration'' of subsystems under its control ``to confirm
continued compliance with security requirements.'' See~\S\ref{Production}
for details of how regular policy enforcement is set up.
