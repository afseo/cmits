\section{Things required to be documented with the IAO}
\label{DocumentedWithIAO}

Several SRG requirements say that this or that thing must be ``documented
with the IAO'' (Information Assurance Officer). This section should point
readers to the places where that documentation resides, or in degenerate
cases (``We don't have any of these things that must be documented with
the IAO'') just say so.
