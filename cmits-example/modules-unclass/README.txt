These Puppet modules provide details of system configuration which are not
specific to any one organization: for example, how to configure an SSH server
in compliance with the DISA Unix SRG.

Most details herein are based on publicly-available security requirements
documents, and are likely suitable for sharing "as widely as possible to
support mission needs" (DoD CIO memo, 16 Oct 2009).
