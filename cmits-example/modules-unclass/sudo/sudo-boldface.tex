\section*{{\huge \#} Auditable {\tt sudo}: a summary}

\subsection{Editing files}

\begin{tabular}{ll}
\emph{To edit} & \emph{Run this command} \\
\hline
/etc/passwd & \texttt{sudo vipw} \\
/etc/group & \texttt{sudo vigr} \\
/etc/shadow & \texttt{sudo vipw -s} \\
/etc/gshadow & \texttt{sudo vigr -s} \\
/etc/sudoers.d/* & \texttt{sudo visudo -f /etc/sudoers.d/\emph{file}} \\
Anything else & \texttt{sudoedit \emph{file}} \\
\end{tabular}

\subsection{Running commands}

\begin{tabular}{p{2.5in}p{2.8in}}
\emph{You can't} & \emph{But you can} \\
\hline
run a shell (\verb!sudo -s!, \verb!sudo bash!) & see what you've done
(\texttt{sudo grep sudo /var/log/messages}) \\
\texttt{sudo cd \emph{/some/root/only/dir}} & \texttt{sudo find
\emph{/some/root/only/dir}} \\
run shell scripts & (exceptions apply, see full rules) \\
run binaries not in system dirs & \ditto \\
run things that execute other things & \ditto \\
\end{tabular}

\subsection{Hand-jamming it}

\begin{enumerate}
% You want your hand-jammed file to be read AFTER the auditable policy.
\item \texttt{sudo visudo -f /etc/sudoers.d/zzz\emph{myusername}}
\item add a line that says \texttt{\emph{myusername} ALL=(ALL) ALL}
\item write and quit
\item do the thing you were trying to do using \verb!sudo!
\item \underline{\texttt{sudo rm /etc/sudoers.d/zzz\emph{myusername}} when done}
\item think about whether and how what you were doing should be
  permanently allowed, and change the rules accordingly (see the CMITS
  policy chapter on Maintenance).
\end{enumerate}

\section*{{\huge $\Rightarrow$} Full rules}

Form: first, terms are defined; rules using the terms follow. So start
reading at the bottom. See \verb!sudoers(5)!.
