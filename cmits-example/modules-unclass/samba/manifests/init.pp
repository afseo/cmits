# The SRG imposes some important
# requirements on how Samba is to be configured (e.g., do not allow guest
# access), which are not merely a matter of switching things on and off but
# impact deployment planning. We do not implement any of these because we do
# not run any Samba servers. Any implementation of Samba servers in the future
# needs to take these into account.
