## This file contains the auditctl rules that are loaded
## whenever the audit daemon is started via the initscripts.
## The rules are simply the parameters that would be passed
## to auditctl.
##
## First rule - delete all
-D

## Increase the buffers to survive stress events.
## Make this bigger for busy systems
-b 8192

## Set failure mode to panic
-f 2

## NOTE:
## 1) if this is being used on a 32 bit machine, comment out the b64 lines
##    [they were deleted in this copy]
## 2) These rules assume that login under the root account is not allowed.
## 3) It is also assumed that 500 represents the first usable user account.
## 4) If these rules generate too much spurious data for your tastes, limit the
## the syscall file rules with a directory, like -F dir=/etc
## 5) You can search for the results on the key fields in the rules

##
## (GEN002880: CAT II) The IAO will ensure the auditing software can
## record the following for each audit event: 
##- Date and time of the event 
##- Userid that initiated the event 
##- Type of event 
##- Success or failure of the event 
##- For I&A events, the origin of the request (e.g., terminal ID) 
##- For events that introduce an object into a user’s address space, and
##  for object deletion events, the name of the object, and in MLS
##  systems, the object’s security level.

## (GEN002900: CAT III) The IAO will ensure audit files are retained at
## least one year; systems containing SAMI will be retained for five years.
##
## Site action - no action in config files

## (GEN002920: CAT III) The IAO will ensure audit files are backed up
## no less than weekly onto a different system than the system being
## audited or backup media.  
##
## Can be done with cron script

## (GEN002700: CAT I) (Previously – G095) The SA will ensure audit data
## files have permissions of 640, or more restrictive.
##
## Done automatically by auditd

## (GEN002720-GEN002840: CAT II) (Previously – G100-G106) The SA will
## configure the auditing system to audit the following events for all
## users and root:
##
# SRG v1r1 GEN002800
## - Logon (unsuccessful and successful) and logout (successful)
##
## Handled by pam, sshd, login, and gdm

##- Process and session initiation (unsuccessful and successful)
##
## The session initiation is audited by pam without any rules needed.
## Might also want to watch this file if needing extra information
#-w /var/run/utmp -p wa -k session
#-w /var/log/btmp -p wa -k session

# \implements{rhel5stig}{GEN002820}

##- Use of print command (unsuccessful and successful) 

##- Export to media (successful)

##- All security personnel actions
## 
## Look for pam_tty_audit and add it to your login entry point's pam configs.
## If that is not found, use sudo which should be patched to record its
## commands to the audit system. Do not allow unrestricted root shells or
## sudo cannot record the action.

## (GEN002860: CAT II) (Previously – G674) The SA and/or IAO will
##ensure old audit logs are closed and new audit logs are started daily.

## Site action. Can be assisted by a cron job
