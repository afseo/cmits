# GEN003605, GEN003606: drop all source routed packets; input, output and
# forwarding.
# 
# In IPv6 source routing is accomplished with a routing header of type 0,
# commonly known as RH0. See http://lwn.net/Articles/232781/.

-A INPUT -m rt --rt-type 0 -j DROP
-A OUTPUT -m rt --rt-type 0 -j DROP
-A FORWARD -m rt --rt-type 0 -j DROP

# According to http://www.sixxs.net/faq/connectivity/?faq=filters, "RH0
# processing is disabled per default since Linux 2.6.20.9," but only in an
# INPUT sense: RH0 headers could still be forwarded, and the above rules will
# stop that from happening.
