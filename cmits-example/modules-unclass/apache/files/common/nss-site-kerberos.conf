# To make use of this, you need two more items of configuration anywhere you're
# going to require authentication, namely, an AuthName and a Require. These are
# usual Apache authentication fare, not Kerberos-specific, so see the Apache
# documentation.
#
# The Require is how you authorize people, and usually you would say, "Require
# group somethingorother." No groups are brought into existence by the above
# configuration; you'll have to make local groups containing usernames like
# user@REALM and use an AuthGroupFile directive, or use some other module to
# obtain groups from another server, e.g. via LDAP.
#
# You also need /etc/http.keytab to exist, with keys in it for
# HTTP/this_hosts_fqdn@REALM. If your Kerberos server is an Active Directory
# host, you need to use ktpass.exe to make this keytab. This cannot be securely
# automated.
