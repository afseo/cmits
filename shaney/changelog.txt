1.12
----

Fixed a thread safety problem in the Tkinter-based graphical build
script, sourapples_tk.

1.11
----

Attendant template files are now gathered and typeset, in the same way
attendant files have been for a long time.

1.10
----

Irregularities in STIGs are more kindly dealt with, e.g. badly-formed escaped
XML inside a STIG, same STIG IDs appearing in multiple STIGs.

1.9
---

Changed index creation to match iadoc 1.5, which makes one compliance index
rather than one index for each requirements document.

1.8
---

A hard dependency on pkg_resources remained after 1.4; it has been made
optional. Added MiKTeX 2.9 binary directories as default LaTeX executable
locations. Also, sourapples now searches the system PATH for LaTeX
executables, after the directories specified in the sourapples config file.

1.7
---

Every build is now preceded by a clean.

1.6
---

Added some legalese at the top of every file.

1.5
---

First tagged version. Some default config differences from 1.4.

1.4
---

sourapples now uses the logging package; Tkinter-based windowed version added;
dependency on Cheetah removed; dependency on pkg_resources made optional; bugs
fixed.

1.3
---

sourapples added, which unifies shaneyg and the three other Python scripts and
eliminates the Makefile. Some files not properly included in the distribution.

1.2
---

Work beginning on unifying the Python scripts and eliminating the Makefile, so
that the unified policy document can be built on platforms where `make` is not
handy.

1.1
---

shaneyg script, run by a Makefile along with three other Python scripts to
build the unified policy document.

Before
------

Look at requirements.txt.
